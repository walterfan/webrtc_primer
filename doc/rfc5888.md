# The Session Description Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework

read http://www.rfcreader.com/#rfc5888

## Abstract

In this specification, we define a framework to group "m" lines in the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for different purposes.  This
framework uses the "group" and "mid" SDP attributes, both of which
are defined in this specification.  Additionally, we specify how to
use the framework for two different purposes: for lip synchronization
and for receiving a media flow consisting of several media streams on
different transport addresses.


a session description contains more than one "m" line, SDP does not provide any means to express a particular relationship between two or more of them.

一个会话描述包含多于一个 "m" 行， SDP 不提供任何手段来表达两个或多个之间的特定关系。

This section provides a non-normative description of how the SDP
Grouping Framework defined in this document works.  In a given
session description, each "m" line is identified by a token, which is
carried in a "mid" attribute below the "m" line.  The session
description carries session-level "group" attributes that group
different "m" lines (identified by their tokens) using different
group semantics.  The semantics of a group describe the purpose for
which the "m" lines are grouped.  For example, the "group" line in
the session description below indicates that the "m" lines identified
by tokens 1 and 2 (the audio and the video "m" lines, respectively)
are grouped for the purpose of lip synchronization (LS).
