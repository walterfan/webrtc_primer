Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)

https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8489



## Abstract

Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves
as a tool for other protocols in dealing with NAT traversal.  It can
be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and port allocated
to it by a NAT.  It can also be used to check connectivity between
two endpoints and as a keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings.
STUN works with many existing NATs and does not require any special
behavior from them.

STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself.  Rather, it is a tool
to be used in the context of a NAT traversal solution.
