Transaction id –Is used to correlate requests and responses.

## Trickle ICE

移动 ICE 是 ICE 协议的推荐扩展，在此协议中，无需等待 ICE 收集过程完成，就可以向其他对等方发送增量更新。 这有助于加快整个设置阶段。

移动 ICE 机制涉及以下步骤：
* 双方交换没有 ICE 候选人的 SDP offer
* 一旦发现 ICE 候选者，便通过信令信道发送它们。
* 只要有新的候选者描述，便会运行 ICE 连接检查



# Why

NAT 是指路由器把本地私有子网IP地址转换称公网 IP 地址的过程。

ICE/STUN/TURN 主要是解决如何在各自内网中的客户端之间如何连接

根据最少限制性到最多限制性来排序可以分为： 

* Full cone（全锥型） 
* Address-restricted cone （地址限制型锥形） 
* Port-restricted cone（端口限制型锥型） 
* Symmetric（对称型）



# How






ICE State 状态非常重要

| Constant 	| Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| "new" 	    | The ICE agent is gathering addresses or is waiting to be given remote candidates through calls to RTCPeerConnection.addIceCandidate() (or both).|
| "checking" 	| The ICE agent has been given one or more remote candidates and is checking pairs of local and remote candidates against one another to try to find a compatible match, but has not yet found a pair which will allow the peer connection to be made. It's possible that gathering of candidates is also still underway. |
| "connected" 	| A usable pairing of local and remote candidates has been found for all components of the connection, and the connection has been established. It's possible that gathering is still underway, and it's also possible that the ICE agent is still checking candidates against one another looking for a better connection to use.|
| "completed" 	| The ICE agent has finished gathering candidates, has checked all pairs against one another, and has found a connection for all components. |
| "failed" 	    | The ICE candidate has checked all candidates pairs against one another and has failed to find compatible matches for all components of the connection. It is, however, possible that the ICE agent did find compatible connections for some components. |
| "disconnected" | Checks to ensure that components are still connected failed for at least one component of the RTCPeerConnection. This is a less stringent test than "failed" and may trigger intermittently and resolve just as spontaneously on less reliable networks, or during temporary disconnections. When the problem resolves, the connection may return to the "connected" state.|
| "closed" 	     | The ICE agent for this RTCPeerConnection has shut down and is no longer handling requests. |
